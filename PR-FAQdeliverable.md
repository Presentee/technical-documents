### Internal FAQs 

Q: What type of permissions do we ask the user to allow to make use of the application to the max, or at minimum?
A: I would think that at a minimum that there is no need to ask the users for permissions, but this would severly limit access to what the user is able to interact with in the application. At the most I would think that microphone and video camera permissions, ability to screen record, maybe access to GPS location of the user. Maybe even information about their device such as operating system that is being used. As well as permissions to receive notifications to the phone when there are updates.

Q: What programming language will be used for the project, and will there be any frameworks or special libraries required to do the job?
A: At the moment the application will most likely be written in javascript, using react for the web app side and maybe transitioned into react native if we wanted to move to a cross plateform direction. If we wanted to go native I think we would split the teams up into Objective-C/Swift/SwiftUI for native iOS development and Java/Kotlin for native android development. As far as libraries, I have researched and found a library of beautiful graphs and charts called Syncfusion that I believe we will use. We will have to be flexible
