# Acme Releases Smart Email to its customers 
Acme’s smart email tool uses predictive text to make writing 
emails 10 times faster 
August 4th, 2019. Acme is excited to announce the addition of smart predictive text to 
our email products. The new capability, “Smart Email”, suggests the next few words in a 
sentence while a customer is typing that email. The customer can hit Enter or Tab to 
accept those words, rather than manually typing each one. Because many of the emails 
that we write tend have a lot of repeated text, this can make composing emails up to 10 
times faster. With Acme Smart Email, you can focus on what is unique and important in 
your email, leaving the rote parts to the smart suggestions. 
Writing emails is a repetitive task and throughout the day, many people type some 
phrases over and over again, like “please see the attached document”, or “let’s schedule a 
meeting next week”. Existing solutions with acronyms and templates have severe 
shortcomings. Acronyms can create confusion or make an email appear rushed and 
impolite. Many people use templates for emails, but templates can be inefficient to edit: 
by the time someone has clicked on the template in a few different places to change the 
text, it might have been quicker and easier to manually type the entire email from 
scratch. 
Smart Email solves the problem of creating long-form emails efficiently by removing the 
redundancy in your typing. If you start typing a sentence like “please see...”, then Smart 
Email might suggest “... the attached documents” and you only need to hit a single key to 
add those words to your email. Smart Email will also learn your style. For example, if you 
sign off emails with “best” or “kind regards”, or if you spell it “color” or “colour”, Smart 
Email will start to learn your stylistic preferences and adapt to those styles. 
Acme Email users can start using this feature today. When you start composing your 
emails within a browser or on our iOS and Android applications, you will now see 
suggestions for the next few words that you might want to type. 
“We are excited to help our customers become much more efficient,’’ said Will Canis-La 
Trans, VP of Product at Acme Communication Technologies, “with Acme Smart Email, 
we are releasing the first of many Machine Learning-driven features to make a more 
delightful product experience.” 
“Smart Email is saving us hundreds of hours of work every week!’’ said Via Velox, 
Director of Marketing at Geo Coccyx, “Smart Email became my team’s new favorite tool. 
After just a few days it learned my style and was suggesting content that sounded 
natural and was composed exactly right for our style-guides!” 
Log on to your Acme Email account today to begin using this feature! You can use the 
feature for free for up to 1,000 emails per week while Acme Email is in beta mode. 
FAQs 
1. How can I start using Acme Smart Email? 
If you log into your Acme Email account at [LINK] or open the Acme Email application 
on your phone, you should immediately see the smart suggestions when you start typing 
your emails. 
2. Do I have to use the suggestions from Acme Smart Email? 
The suggestions from Acme Smart Email are optional: you can ignore them and type 
whatever you like. You can also turn off Acme Smart Email entirely in Settings -> Smart 
Settings. 
3. Do smart suggestions also work in Acme Docs and Acme Sheets? 
No, today the smart suggestions are limited to Acme Email. 
4. What languages does Acme Smart Email work in? 
Today, Acme Smart Email works in English, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, Chinese 
(simplified), Matsés, and German. We will add more languages in the future and 
welcome suggestions about what language to support next! 
5. How does Acme Smart Email learn from my emails? 
Smart Email uses state-of-the-art Machine Learning models to adapt to your style and 
learn how to write some of your sentences for you. 
When you type the same sequence of words a few times, like “please see the attached 
document”, then Smart Email can learn that “please see the attached...” is often followed 
by “...document”. Smart Email starts with a lot of this kind of knowledge out-of-the-box 
and then also adapts to your style. If you often type “please see the 
attached presentation”, then Acme Smart Email will learn this pattern and start 
suggesting “...presentation” rather than “...document” to complete your sentence. So, it 
will get smarter the more that you use it! 
6. Do you use my emails to help with suggestions for other customers? 
No, your data security is our top priority. We don’t share the content of your emails with 
anyone else. The predictive-text capabilities that are customized for you are also only 
available to you: we don’t change other people’s suggestions based on what we learned 
from you. 
7. How long will it take Acme Smart Email to learn my style? 
It generally takes about 1,000 emails before you get the best benefits from Acme Smart 
Email. Our customers start seeing a 2x to 5x speed-up straight away, but it is not until 
1,000 or so emails have been written that you might see the 10x speed-up that a lot of our 
customers enjoy. 
There is no time constraint on this. If you typically send 1,000 emails in one day, then 
you should start seeing very large speed-ups within one day! 
Internal FAQs 
1. What will customers like most about Acme Smart Email? 
Customers will like the increase in efficiency it gives them, coupled with the general 
delight in removing the most redundant parts of writing emails. 
2. What will customers like least about Acme Smart Email? 
Customers will be disappointed in the language coverage. In particular, we have many 
customers in Latin America who use both Spanish and Portuguese, but we only support 
Spanish in the first release. We will personally reach out to these customers in advance to 
acknowledge that Portuguese is missing and that it is a high priority for a future version 
of the product. 
3. What are the privacy concerns with this product? 
We assume that emails will contain personally identifying information (PII) and that this 
information can be contained in the Machine Learning models that are predicting 
someone’s text. Therefore, if someone deletes an email, we also delete the models for the 
customer that were trained on that email. 
4. How do we compare to our competitors? 
Our biggest competitor, GeezMail, already has predictive text for their email customers, 
so we are catching up. They offer more languages today. However, they don’t customize 
to each individual customer, so our predictive text quickly becomes much more accurate
