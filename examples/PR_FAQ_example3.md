Bellevue College is excited to announce the release of a new degree auditing tool called 
AuditNow.  This application can convert an entire batch of degree audits into a set of 
formatted excel spreadsheets with the click of a button.  It can then upload any number 
of those spreadsheets to the AuditNow web application in a matter  of seconds, and 
generate a variety of reports  about the audits.  
Degree auditing can be a repetitive and time-consuming task.  In the past, advisors had 
to download degree audits, review them, and manually update excel spreadsheets one 
student at a time.  There was always the potential that the spreadsheets could contain 
typos, making the audit less accurate.  And there was no easy way to generate reports 
of all the students.  If an advisor wanted to estimate the ideal course capacity for an 
upcoming class, they needed to check every student’s spreadsheet one by one.   
With AuditNow these tasks can be done in minutes instead of hours.  The application 
can automatically generate formatted spreadsheets from audits, and upload them to the 
AuditNow web application.  Once the audits have been uploaded to the web application, 
the user can quickly generate reports for course capacity planning, course success 
rates, and year-to-year comparisons.    
Starting today, users can download the desktop application for free and request an 
account for the web application by visiting www.auditnow.com.  
“We are very excited to provide this streamlined solution for such a time-consuming 
process to the Bellevue College CS department”, said Jasmine Battle, software 
developer at Bellevue College, “We hope that AuditNow can expand to other 
departments throughout the school as well”. 
“AuditNow has significantly decreased the amount of time spent on degree auditing!” 
said Fatma Serce, professor and Chair of the Computer Science Department. 
“AuditNow has become a lifesaver for the CS department. It is now so easy  to generate 
spreadsheets using the desktop application which can easily be shared across the 
department using the web application.”

Frequently Asked Questions: 
Q: Why would I want to use this system? 
A: This system uses cutting edge technology and automation to save you time. 
This allows you as an advisor to spend more time focusing on your students and 
less time on administrative tasks like course planning and degree auditing. 
Q: Do I still  need to login and run an audit for each student? 
A: No. AuditNow will scan a secure file with student identification numbers and, 
using your Advisor access, will login, download, and generate an audit for each 
student on the list, populating a single dated folder which you can choose to run 
through our various analyses. 
Q: Will  AuditNow tell  me how many students still  need to take a course at a given 
time? 
Yes. AuditNow’s algorithm will analyze the degree audits for all students who are 
actively enrolled in the program, and generate totals for how many students of 
each grade level need to take various courses. 
Q: Does AuditNow help with more than degree planning? 
A: Yes. AuditNow can help analyze the data from the entire program to check for 
various trends and statistics. Year to year comparisons, subcategories of 
students, and filtering for other factors are immeasurably important tools for 
optimizing our new and growing department. 
Q: Why are there both desktop and web applications? 
A: Both applications are useful in their own regard, and together they combine to 
form a powerful tool. Since there are multiple advisors in the program, each 
advisor can use their desktop application to generate and analyze data about the 
students they advise. The files in the desktop application are saved locally, so no 
one else will have access to them unless they are uploaded to the web 
application.  The web application allows some data for all of the students to be 
analyzed together, as well as the sharing of data between advisors. 
Q: What formats of data does AuditNow work with? 
A: The AuditNow desktop application allows users to upload degree audits in 
HTML and PDF formats, and can convert them into XLS and CSV files.  The user 
can then upload those XLS and CSV files to the AuditNow web application. 
Q: I love AuditNow! Can I share it with my peers who work in other departments 
or at other schools? 
A: Currently AuditNow is a product only for Bellevue College Computer Science 
Advisors. Future releases may expand it to serve a wider clientele. 
 
Internal FAQs: 
Q: What will the customers like most about AuditNow? 
A: Customers will enjoy the convenience and speed of being able to upload 
several audits in one batch.  They will also enjoy the ability to easily generate a 
wide variety of reports on the audits.  
Q: What will the customers like least about AuditNow? 
A: Customers may dislike that the desktop program only allows users to upload 
PDF and HTML files.  They may also dislike the format of the CSV and XLS files 
generated by the desktop application.   
Q: What are the security concerns for this product? 
A: The degree audits contains personal information on students that needs to be 
protected,  particularly when the audits are uploaded to the AuditNow web 
application.  To address these concerns, users will be required to login before 
they can use the website, and they will have limited permission to use some of 
the website’s features depending on their credentials. 
Q: Why would the customers choose AuditNow over competing programs? 
A: AuditNow is free to download, making it cheaper than competing programs.  
Additionally, the spreadsheets and reports it generates are specifically tailored to 
match the needs of BC’s computer science department.   
Q: What infrastructure is needed for AuditNow’s backend storage? 
A: AuditNow uses a simple document-based storage for the desktop application. 
No preexisting infrastructure is needed for it to run on a computer. The web-
based application uses a cloud-based RDS, which has some operational costs 
associated with it. 
Q: What dependencies does AuditNow rely on? 
A: AuditNow’s automatic audit generation hooks into the Washington State 
Community and Technical College website. Changes to that site will require 
changes to this component's API. The web application also has dependencies on 
cloud service providers for storage and web hosting.
