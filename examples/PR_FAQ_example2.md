# ReviewsReader releases review summarization tool 
to its customers
ReviewsReader web application uses AI to transform 
reviews into easier faster more successful bookings.
June 25, 2021 - Seattle,WA 
ReviewsReader is excited to announce the addition of a smart review web 
application. It allows travelers to skip reading long hotel reviews by providing 
them with a short summary of a chosen property. Also, it helps hotel owners 
by providing smart suggestions and important improvement tips they can 
use to make their business more successful. Because reading reviews is 
time-consuming, ReviewsReader allows travelers to focus on what is really 
important in your next stay. It gives them all important information about the 
property in the glance of an eye.
Finding the best hotel is not easy, especially if you are not familiar with the 
destination. Maybe you have a child that is a light sleeper and you need an 
accommodation away from noises, or perhaps you want to head to a party 
spot and you are looking for some accommodation near your concert 
location. People have different preferences and matching these preferences 
can take a long time.
ReviewsReader can find insights for any hotel you are looking for by reading 
thousands of reviews for you, so you don’t need to spend more than a few 
minutes to find out what to expect from your stay. Over 2,000,000 reviews 
have been classified into positive and negative sentiments using Sentiment 
Analysis. ReviewsReader serves travelers by showing the positive and 
negative aspects of a property at a glance without needing to read through 
every review. Users don’t have to spend valuable time scrolling through 
reviews anymore. 
You can start using ReviewsReader today. Go to ReviewsReader.com, enter a 
property you’d like to stay in to get a short informative summary of it. Make 
a decision not only based on the star rating and owner specified features, but 
also by features that other travelers found important or unique.
“We are excited to launch our first review insight platform to help travelers

“I like traveling but finding a good place to stay was always challenging for 
me. I had an awful experience when I stayed in a place with broken air 
conditioning. The temperature in the room was over 90 degrees.  Afterward, I 
decided to read reviews, and a lot of people were talking about this issue. 
Booking that hotel was a last-minute decision, and unfortunately, I didn’t 
have a lot of time to read through a gazillion of reviews. A friend 
recommended trying out the ReviewsReader website. I didn’t expect much 
but OMG I don’t know how they did it.This tool reads reviews for me and 
gives a short but very accurate summary of the features of any property. 
That summary shows me the cons and pros of the place and helps me decide 
whether this place is for me or not in a matter of seconds. I already used it 
for booking my last 4 trips, and that saved me a lot of time! I highly 
recommend it to travel lovers and busy people. Moreover, it is 100% free!” - 
Marizza Pia Spirito, Traveler
“This website is just what I always needed. It helps me increase the number 
of bookings for my rental properties. It saves my employees a lot of time and 
saves me a lot of money by providing high-quality feedback from our guests 
in a concise form. We addressed a couple of user concerns that the 
ReviewsReader platform suggested, and now, our properties get the best 
reviews. Also, it helped us to increase discoverability by identifying amenities 
that weren’t added to the property description during posting creation. I am 
very happy with the tool and I highly recommend it!” - Pablo Bustamante, 
CEO of Las Vegas Vacation Rental Agency
To start using ReviewsReader, go to ReviewsReader.com, look for a property 
you’d like to stay in, and enjoy the short informative summary without 
reading through thousands of reviews.
